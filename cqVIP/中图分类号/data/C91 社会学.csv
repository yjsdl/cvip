"Bibliometric Analysis of Urban Resilience Research in China","HU Meng-zhu;Emergency Management Training Department, Party School of Shandong Provincial Committee (Shandong Academy of Governance);","The topic of urban resilience in the context of risk society is hotly debated by the academic community. This paper, with the documents in the CNKI database as the sample, analyzes the current research situation of urban resilience in China, summarizes the research hotspots, and sorts out the research context by using the document metrology method and CiteSpace software. The results show that the study of urban toughness has gone through three stages: The initial stage, the slow-increasing stage, and the steep-increasing stage; the research mainly focuses on the interpretation of the concept of resilience and its theoretical evolution, urban disaster prevention and mitigation, resilience assessment, economic resilience, resilient city construction, and resilient governance; there are three stages of advancement in the evolution of the research, and disaster resilience, resilience theory research, and resilience governance are the key research nodes. It is suggested that the research on urban resilience in China should make breakthroughs in the following four aspects: Developing and improving a theoretical system of urban resilience with Chinese characteristics; focusing on the resilience of the urban public health system; strengthening research on the resilience of urban communities; and expanding research on resilient governance in the digital age.","urbanresilience;riskgovernance;evolutionalthread;bibliometricanalysis;CiteSpace;","中共山东省委党校（山东行政学院）2022年青年人才专项课题“我国农村基层政权组织建设路径的历史演变逻辑研究”（22YT003）；;中共山东省委党校（山东行政学院）2021年创新工程科研支撑项目“第一书记与农村基层政权组织建设效果研究”（2021CX120）；","","(G) Politics/ Military Affairs/ Law; (H) Education ＆ Social Sciences; (I) Electronic Technology ＆ Information Science","Sociology and Statistics; Library Science and Digital Library","C912.81;G353.1","JournalofShandongAcademyofGovernance.;2022(05);Page:118-128"

"日本商务交往中的名片礼仪","","名片是一种身份象征和社交工具，是正常社交中不可缺少的润滑剂。在日本商务场合，初次见面寒暄一定要交换名片，对于对方的第一印象来自他的名片，名片交换决不能随随便便应付。它是商务中的“问候”之一，是交流的第一步。日本人认为能否正确交换名片是社会人应具备的基本行为，因为日本社会等级制度森严，名片不仅是一种身份象征，也是双方合作的开始，在商务场合起到缩短与对方距离的作用，使商务交往更加顺利进行。","商务场合;名片;礼仪;","","10.19311/j.cnki.1672-3198.2022.22.024","(J) Economics ＆ Management; (H) Education ＆ Social Sciences","Sociology and Statistics; Trade Economy","C912.1;F733.13","ModernBusinessTradeIndustry.;2022(22);Page:61-63"
"On Policy Sociology: Philosophical Paradigm, Theoretical Basis, and Practical Tool","CHEN Zhi-guang;LI Bing;Department of Sociology, Party School of Beijing Municipal Committee of CPC[Beijing Administration Institute];","Policy sociology is a cross discipline of sociology and policy science, which regards policy as a specific social phenomenon and studies the interaction and influence between society and policy by using the theories, methods and technologies of sociology and policy science. From a philosophical point of view, the philosophical basis of policy sociology is a comprehensive policy philosophy. To be more specific, historical materialism and dialectical materialism capture the essence and characteristics of policy; situationism, as a philosophical basis for policy activities, provides a boundary and transversal; and futurism provides “insight” and “regularity” to the policy process. From a theoretical point of view, social existence is the foundation and foundation of policy formulation and determines the direction and value of policy formulation; different social operating systems have different policy implementation efficiencies, and the same policy is not efficient under different social operating systems. Social understanding, on the other hand, includes both the objective causal exploration of social action and the comprehension and interpretation of subjective meaning. From a practical point of view, policy sociology has its own unique tools: Social regulatory tools to strongly safeguard policies; social incentive tools to effectively promote policies; social advocacy tools to extensively interpret policies; and social participation tools to supplement policy subjects; social information tools to facilitate policy implementation.","PolicySociology;philosophicalparadigm;theoreticalbasis;practicaltool;","国家社科基金青年项目“农业转移人口市民化推进机制研究”（15CRK011）；","","(G) Politics/ Military Affairs/ Law; (F) Literature/ History/ Philosophy; (H) Education ＆ Social Sciences","Philosophy; Administration Science and National Administration; Sociology and Statistics","B0-0;C91;D035","JournalofShandongAcademyofGovernance.;2022(05);Page:64-70"
